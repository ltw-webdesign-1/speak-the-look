## Hand in

On GitHub’s website, on your forked repository, create an Issue labeled “Solution”—and tag your teacher.

**Record yourself speaking the answer—and upload/drop it into the GitHub Issue body.** (You’ll have to _zip_ the audio file before GitHub will allow you to drop it into an Issue.)

Read out the CSS, selectors, properties, values, etc. Here’s an example of what the recording would sound like (using different content).

<audio controls src="https://assets.learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/web-design-1/speak-the-look.mp3"></audio>

**Don’t forget to tag your teacher!**
